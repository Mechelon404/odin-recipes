            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Gnocchi is a type of Italian pasta. In Italy the term gnocchi refer to a fairly large number of pasta varieties, although the most frequent are those made from potato. The gnocchi go way back to Roman times. They were made from semolina dough, mixed with eggs. Roman legions spread the dish throughout the the European region where they have conquered and it became a peasant delicacy as the gnocchi was inexpensive, easy to prepare.</p>
